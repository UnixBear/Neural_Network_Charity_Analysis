        "SVMs are a type of binary classifier that use geometric boundaries to distinguish data points from two separate groups. More specifically, SVMs try to calculate a geometric hyperplane that maximizes the distance between the closest data point of both groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ovUOpLO.png\">\n",
        "Unlike logistic regression, which excels in classifying data that is linearly separable but fails in nonlinear relationships, SVMs can build adequate models with linear or nonlinear data. Due to SVMs' ability to create multidimensional borders, SVMs lose their interpretability and behave more like the black box machine learning models, such as basic neural networks and deep learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "SVMs, like neural networks, can analyze and interpret multiple data types, such as images, natural language voice and text, or tabular data. SVMs perform one task and one task very well—they classify and create regression using two groups. In contrast, neural networks and deep learning models are capable of producing many outputs, which means neural network models can be used to classify multiple groups within the same model. Over the years, techniques have been developed to create multiple SVM models side-by-side for multiple classification problems, such as creating multiple SVM kernels. However, a single SVM is not capable of the same outputs as a single neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we only compare binary classification problems, SVMs have an advantage over neural network and deep learning models:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Neural networks and deep learning models will often converge on a local minimum. In other words, these models will often focus on a specific trend in the data and could miss the \"bigger picture.\"\n",
        "- SVMs are less prone to overfitting because they are trying to maximize the distance, rather than encompass all data within a boundary.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these advantages, SVMs are limited in their potential and can still miss critical features and high-dimensionality relationships that a well-trained deep learning model could find. However, in many straightforward binary classification problems, SVMs will outperform the basic neural network, and even deep learning models with ease.\n",
        "\n",
        "To compare and contrast the performance of an SVM versus deep learning model, we'll try to build a binary classifier using the same input data. This [adapted real-world dataset](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-online/module_19/bank_telemarketing.csv) contains bank telemarketing metrics that can be used to predict whether or not a customer is likely to subscribe to a banking service after being targeted by telemarketing advertisements. From this dataset, we want to build a binary classifier using an SVM and deep learning model and compare the predictive accuracy of either model."
